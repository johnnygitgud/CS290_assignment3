        <h1 >Welcome to Johnny's IT/Computer Science/Security writeups, guides, walkthroughs and more. . .</h1>

        <div class="container">
        <p class="containee">I hope you'll find something helpful here. In this home page you'll find links to all kinds of different walkthroughs. From Capture the flag writeups to troubleshooting steps for a particular issue I felt needed to be documented.<br>
            Most of what you'll find you here will be Computer Scinece related. Sometimes I may discuss projects that I'm working on. The point is for this website is for it to become a useful blog for myself and someday for others as well. <br>
            Currently the website is in its early stages of development and will hopefully improve overtime. I hope you stick around and like what you see. Happy learning.<br>
